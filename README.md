# All Credits go to https://github.com/damuY/NerdPack-Yumad !

Only Retribution CR updated, the other ones won't even show up in Nerdpack.
You might consider to download the Retribution CR file only and copy it into the original Yumad Rotation.

Changes:

 * Added AskMrRobot Rotation (performs better with high haste)

 * Added forced Singletarget for SimC and AMR Rotations

 * Added Spelllist (required by newer NeP-Versions)

 * Updated Talent suggestions
